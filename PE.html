        <h3>Acquired Skills</h3>
        Being the first digital agency in my career and being one among the best in Rome, 
        I've learned to be proficient in a fast-paced work environment. The great variety of work, 
        technologies and prestigious clients involved makes it an interesting place to work in, 
        always on the run to grant quality code on tight deadlines.

        <h3>Role</h3>
        Web development of second-screen mobile applications
        <h3>Acquired Skills</h3>
        The great challenge I took was to introduce responsive web design in our projects. 
        Initially the apps were optimized only for a few models of the iPhone and the iPad, 
        it has been my concern and initiative to refactor the front-end code, 
        by introducing new languages and tools such as Sass and Css Preprocessors in our workflow, 
        for the two company’s flagship apps (Mediaset and Aljazeera America The Stream). 
        This made them optimized for any device through a mixture of responsive web design, CSS3 and jQuery. 
        Another major challenge I faced and overcome has been working with dynamic content. 
        The company’s apps are in fact delivered to the customer that manages their content through a CMS, 
        and in order to deliver a product that is robust and always well formatted, 
        I closely worked with the programmers team to create a solution that grants a level 
        of reliability high enough to sustain any unexpected content behaviour.

        Development of the HTML and CSS of the web, mobile and wap pages of Neomobile’s 
        digital products for the following company’s markets: Brazil, Spain, France, Mexico, C
        olombia, Ecuador, Italy, Peru, Germany. I’ve occasionally took part in developing internal tools and projects.
        <h3>Acquired Skills</h3>
        Being in a very well structured company, with clear and defined work procedures, 
        helped me grow both personally and professionally, as well as enjoying a young and international 
        working environment. I had the opportunity to redefine the way I work in a more intelligent way. 
        I definitely improved my technical knowledge thanks to an excellent team leader who had taught me a 
        lot and I’ve gained a mature work vision, learning to work in team and always keeping in mind that 
        the detail is never disconnected from a broader context.
